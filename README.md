# Kattis Quickstart

Just a handy little script to quickly setup a problem environment for Kattis.

You probably don't need to clone this repository, just see download init.sh.

`./init.sh [problem_name: required] [number of sample files: default 1]`

For each sample file, you will be asked to paste the following information:

1. The Sample Input

2. The Sample Output

This will automatically setup a folder named after the problem with a sample
C++ file and a makefile configured to test against all of the samples.
